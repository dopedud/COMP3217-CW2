    \section{Problem Statement}

        The problem given is to detect physical cyber-attacks on a power system framework configuration using machine
        learning (ML). The training data given to train the ML algorithm are 2 \verb|.csv| files, each containing 6,000
        system traces, with each of those containing 128 features. From the first training file, the last column is a 
        marker that serves as a label indicating whether an event to the power system is a normal event (labelled as 0) 
        or a data injection attack (labelled as 1). The second file represents the same thing, with the addition of the 
        third event, a command injection attack (labelled as 2).
